# WebComic-Crawler
A small collection of scripts for downloading select webcomics in their entirety and update themselves with their current position ready for any new comic updates.

Independant Scripts:
- Bear Nuts
- Broodhollow (site no longer updated?)
- Goblins
- Oglaf
- Sequential Art
- Spinnerette
- Trying Human

The following are headers and need Tapas.inc to run:
- Brutally Honest (Deya Muniz)
- Cassandra Comics (Cassandra Calin)
- Fangs (Sarah Andersen)
- Sarah's Scribbles (Sarah Andersen)
- The Pigeon Gazette (Pigeoneer Jane)
- Undying Happiness (Zelkats)

I'm (on and off) working on trying to get all the independant scripts to work similar to the Tapas bunch and just use one main include script but it's a bit of a slog due to the variety of ways sites implement their code...
